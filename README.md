# Welcome to FourSwipes
A collaborative effort to bring non-nuanced, non-biased, and factual news. We seek to use the IBM Watson's NLP interface to track different stats about articles posted on our site, and hope to bring those heuristics into a format that makes it understandable and digestable for the user. Interested in working with us? 

## The Team: 
Erwin Acuario 
Veltson Bastien

## Dev Resources 
1) Use https://draftjs.org/ to give users a way to write once we get there. 
2) Use https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/integrating-with-an-existing-react-project as a way to display the rich text that we will have on the site. 

## Getting Started 
This is a typical Node / React / Next.js type environment, so upon cloning make sure that you've followed these steps: 
1) Ensure that you have React installed (you might have to also install Babel if you've never had React before...) 
2) Run an "npm install" and an "npm init" to make sure that you have everything properly put together. 
3) To run the dev environment make sure to use "npm run dev" and it should be on localhost:3000

## Things aren't working? 
1) Check your file path to make sure that your capitalization is perfectly matching to what is actually in the file structure. I promise you, this issue will give you headaches for days and it is easily missed. 
2) Make sure that you have everything installed properly. Start at the top of the overly large blurb of text that gets spit out when things go wrong, and try to search it up on Google to get a hint at what it could be. 
3) If code was working (aka the version that you pulled down was claimed to have been working) and you're all of a sudden getting code errors, contact the person who last pushed and have them work with you. 
4) When we get there- make sure that you have the proper and latest updated .env file.

We need writers! Any writers interesting in working with us, please connect with Veltson at veltson@amberxmedia.com
